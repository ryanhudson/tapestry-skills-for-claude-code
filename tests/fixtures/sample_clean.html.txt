How to Write Better Code

Writing clean code is essential for maintainability. In this article, we'll explore best practices.

First, always use meaningful variable names. Instead of x or temp, use descriptive names like userCount or totalPrice.

Second, keep functions small and focused. Each function should do one thing well.

Third, write tests for your code. Testing helps catch bugs early and documents expected behavior.
